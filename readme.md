# broccoli boilerplate
This is the asset I use for starting new projects which will use *broccoli* as their building tool.
Since Broccoli is still in its beta phase, the boilerplate will be updated in case of changes as well as if I find new needs or better plugins.

The projects will be based on:
  - ES6 and React.js with polyfill and modules
  - Sass
